      <h2>You Need Balance.</h2>

        <h4>
        
          <p >Set a reasonable work schedule and let your team members know your boundaries between work and home. Do not feel like you always need to work overtime just because it is available, even if it seems like your team members expect it.
          </p>
          <p > Prioritize your health. You cannot be a good employee, spouse, parent, or friend when you are constantly sick or in pain. Decide how much time you need for exercise, meditation, and hobbies. Then schedule it into your week just like you would anything else. Be sure to commit to a healthy diet and getting regular refreshing sleep as well.</p>

          <p >Delegate duties at home, if possible. Everyone who is old enough to pitch in should participate in chores to help keep your household running. If you are a single parent or have babies or toddlers, you may need to consider hiring outside help to get everything done and give you more free time. Develop a support system of people you can rely on when you are away at work. </p>

          <p>Limit time-wasting activities and people
              First, identify what is most important in your life. This list will differ for everyone, so make sure it truly reflects your priorities, not someone else is. Next, draw firm boundaries so you can devote quality time to these high-priority people and activities.</p>

          <p>Request flex time. This can give you more control over your work life and greater job satisfaction.</p>
